# React Boilerplate v 1.0
A simple boiler plate to create react apps without all the hullabaloo of using create-react-app. And it's a much smaller file.

## Build Notes:
The webpack config and package.json is configured with a few things in mind:
  * SASS pre-processor & CSS style sheets
  * static files
  * ES5+
  * JSX
  * Typescript
  * Linting
  * Testing (MochaJS)
  * React 
  * ~~(local environment variables)~~
